This is a repository of images showcasing my projects and experiences in coffee. These include pop-ups I've hosted, drinks I've made, and other relevant work.

## Creature of Habit - Pop-Up No. 1: Sunrise, Sunset
The first pop-up I hosted was the inception of my brand idea, and I focused on having an input on every detail as I could. The theme centered around the transition from Summer to Fall. As someone who suffers from seasonal affective disorder, I've always felt sadness when summer ends, mixed with a sense of dread for the coming fall and winter weather. I wanted this pop-up to celebrate the summer season and welcome in the new fall season. This is where the name _Sunrise, Sunset_ came from, and I hosted it on the weekend of the Fall Equinox, September 21 & 22, 2024.

I was involved in all the aspects of the pop-up including:
  - Coffee Selection
  - Creation of Drink Menu
  - Creation of Pastry Menu
  - Retro-fitting and plumbing a coffee bar
  - Creating and Sourcing ceramicware
  - Apartment layout redesign
  - Handmaking drink ingredients and garnishes
  - Building a brand for Creature of Habit
  - Screenprinting Merchandise

## Coffee Selection
I hosted several coffee cuppings and drink testing sessions to dial in what coffees/drinks I wanted to serve. For the cuppings, I picked 7 single orgins from varying countries and processes to select 2 to serve as single orgin pourovers and espresso. I focused on choosing 2 coffees, 1 coffee being a sweeter & slightly more tradional tasting coffee that would cater to those who may not have as much of a developed pallette for black specilaity coffee. IU ended up choosing a washed bourbon/catuai/caturra from Honurdas that had a very nice sweetness with a delicated/rounded acidity I figured would tasted good to anyone with/without added milk. For the 2nd selection I wanted something more nuanced and bold, something a coffee nerd could appreciate. I selected an anaerobic/washed castillo from Colombia. This coffee was very bright with lime zest acidity that was balanced out by slightly yogurt like body/fermented vibe. 

##Creation of Drink Menu
From the start I knew I wanted to have a very comprehensive drink menu with several seasonal specials. Once complaint I've had about many cafes and coffee shops I've been to is the drink menu tends to feel clunky. Its littered with so many choices that are nearly always going to be servered on a coffee menu and they tend to just look too crowded/overwhelming. I was inspired by La cabras drink menu and how they've simplified alot of their milk drink titles, and I decided with the shear amount of drink I was serving to adopt this approach. I was very please with how the final menu aesthetic turned out. The seasonal drink selections were driven by the theme and easily acessible seasonal produce. I chose Sunrise to be a hot and warming drink to welcome in the start of the new fall season. The highlight of this drink was the cascara syrup that was homemade with warming spices. This was a different take on a typical fall spice/pumpkin spice drink since it had similar spices, but had added umami and acidity from the cascara flavor and lemon juice in the syrup. This was balanaced out by a homemade white miso oil. THis is added to the milk before steaming to add salt and umami to the drink to balance out those sweet/acidic flavors. Finally, the milk was dusted with beetroot powder to give the aethetic of a sunrise in the latte art. o chpse Sunset to be a cold and refreshing drink, a great ode to the hot summer months.

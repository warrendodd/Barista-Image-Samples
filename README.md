## Creature of Habit - Pop-Up No. 1: Sunrise, Sunset
The first pop-up I hosted was the inception of my brand idea, and I focused on having as much input on every detail as I could. The theme centered around the transition from Summer to Fall. As someone who suffers from Seasonal Affective Disorder, I've always felt sadness when summer ends, mixed with a sense of dread for the coming fall and winter weather. I wanted this pop-up to celebrate the summer season and welcome in the new fall season. This is where the name _Sunrise, Sunset_ came from, and I hosted it on the weekend of the Fall Equinox, September 21 & 22, 2024.

I was involved in all the aspects of the pop-up including:
  - [Coffee Selection](https://github.com/warrendodd/Barista-Image-Samples/blob/main/README.md#coffee-selection)

  - [Drink Order Automation](https://github.com/warrendodd/Barista-Image-Samples/blob/main/README.md#drink-order-automation)

Many of these tasks were completed with the help of my life and pop-up partner. She helped greatly with drink testing (there's only so much caffeine I can handle!), as well as with providing feedback on many aspects of the pop-up. Her skills in ceramics and cooking greatly influenced the way we decided to produce drinkware, ingredients, and garnishes. We moved furniture together, made syrups together, lamented over long shipping times together, and rejoiced over the success of the weekend together.

## Coffee Selection
I hosted several coffee cuppings and drink testing sessions to dial in what coffees/drinks I wanted to serve. I wanted to select two balanced single-origin options for both espresso and pourovers. For the cuppings, I picked seven single-origin coffees from varying countries and processes. I focused on choosing 2 coffees for the pop-up, 1 coffee being a sweeter and slightly more tradional-tasting coffee that would cater to those who may not have as much of a developed pallette for black specialty coffee. 

I ended up choosing a washed bourbon/catuai/caturra from Honurdas that had a very nice sweetness with a delicate/rounded acidity. I felt this coffee would taste good to a variety of pallettes with/without added milk. For the second selection I wanted something more nuanced and bold - something a coffee nerd could appreciate. I selected an anaerobic/washed castillo from Colombia. This coffee was very bright with a lime zest acidity that was balanced out by a slightly yogurt-like body and fermented vibe.

## Creation of Drink Menu
From the start, I knew I wanted to have a very comprehensive drink menu with several seasonal specials. One complaint I've had about many cafes and coffee shops I've been to is that the drink menu tends to feel clunky. That is, it is littered with so many unoriginal and ubiquitous choices, which simply makes the menu look too crowded/overwhelming. I was inspired by La Cabras drink menu and how they've simplified a lot of their milk drink titles, and I decided to adopt this approach. I was very pleased with how the final menu aesthetic turned out.

The seasonal drink specials were driven by the theme and easily-accessible seasonal produce. I chose "Sunrise" to be a hot and warming drink to welcome in the start of the new fall season. The highlight of this drink was the cascara tea syrup that was homemade with warming spices. This was a different take on a typical fall spice/pumpkin spice drink since it had similar spices, but had added umami and acidity from the cascara flavor and lemon juice in the syrup. This was balanaced out by a homemade white miso oil, which was added to the milk before steaming, bringing salt and umami to the drink to balance out those sweet/acidic flavors. The steamed milk was dusted with beetroot powder to give the latte art the aesthetic of a sunrise. The finishing touch was a spritz of orange blossom water. I also designed this drink to be optionally served with hojicha instead of espresso for those who don't enjoy coffee as much.

"Sunrise", the hot drink special

I chose "Sunset" to be a cold and refreshing drink, a great ode to the hot summer months. I knew I wanted this to be an espresso tonic drink since it's one of my personal favorite iced drinks. Plus, I knew if others were encouraged to order it as a special, they would enjoy it too. This drink highlights the more delicate sweetness and acicdity of peaches. To me, peach pairs really well with espresso and the botanicals and pithy bitterness of Fever Tree Tonic Water. The drink starts off with homemade peach nectar and orgeat syrup, and then is layered with tonic and a splash of pomegranate juice (also seasonal). Finally, a garnish of a homemade candied orange dusted in aleppo pepper is placed over the floating ice. This drink was addictingly refreshing, with the a great balance of acid, sweetness, and sublte heat from the aleppo pepper. This could also be served with matcha in-place of the espresso. "Sunset" was the most popular drink, with over fifteen being made over the course of the weekend. 

The final special was a nod to our brand, Creature of Habit. Riffing off of rituals and routines of my childhood, I reminisced about the pb&j sandwich, a lunch I ate for years and never got tired of. It was the predictable meal that brought me comfort; I always knew what to expect. I expanded upon this to incorporate muscadine grapes, an ingredient I've fallen in love with the past couple of years with a wild and bold flavor that was in its peak season. We made a muscadine jam without pectin. The jam came out very sauce-like and could be more easily incorporated into a drink. The jam is mixed with espresso, peanut butter, and milk, all of which are shaken together to give it that slight edge of mouthfeel over a tradional iced latte. Finally, it's garnished with a pretzel, another lunch snack from many of our childhoods (and perhaps adulthoods).

## Creation of Pastry Menu
The creation of the pastry menu was done in partnership with my mother, a very talented home cook and baker. We brainstormed what pastries we could serve that would be easy to prep for two days and serve as single portions. Our options needed to be unique and compliment the drink menu. Finally, we also knew we wanted to have a savory, a sweet, a gluten free, and a vegan option. Our final menu included caneles (her personal speciality); a vegan sourdough focaccia with oranges, castelvatrano olives, and chili oil; a walnut & plain sourdough with homemade seasonal jams; and a gluten-free almond cake. We sold out of everything both days!

##  Retrofitting and Plumbing a coffee bar
I knew to keep up with the volume for the cafe pop-up, I needed to optomize workflow during service. I decided to buy an old and inexpensive antique kitchen island with a butcher block and convert it into a coffee bar. The bar included all my equipment: my Breville Dual Boiler espresso machine, a Eureka Mignon Silencio for grinding for espresso drinks, a Fellow Ode with SSP burrs for handpours, and a Fellow Stagg Kettle. I designed the bar layout to match my workflow and started to incorportate aspects that would increase efficiency and limit how many times I needed to step away. This included plumbing my machine's water reservoir and pitcher rinser to an internal 5 gallon water jug with recipe water, adding a knockbox cutout, adding a line from the drip tray to the pitcher rinser (which has an "out" line to gray water), putting up shelves for glass/ceramic ware/ other tools, setting up a nearby automatic spigot to 5 gallons of recipe filter coffee water, and finally, placing a mini fridge nearby for milks and other ingredients

## Creating and Sourcing Ceramicware
I've always been intrigued by how the drinkware adds to the experience of the drink. I love when coffee shops take this into considereation when choosing their drinkware, and I wanted to do the same. To go along with the theme of making everything, I tried my hand at pottery to try and create sets of ceramic cups for the pop-up. I wanted control over the fine-tuning volume and thickness of the cup so I could get consistent drinks everytime. Because of this, I thought slipcasting the mugs would be the best tool for creating repeatable and identical mugs. 

I designed a form I liked, and then scaled it based on the type of mug I wanted. This ended up being a 2oz espresso, 4 oz cortado, 8 oz cappucino, and 12 oz latte sized mugs. In practice, this ended up being a lot more challenging than anticipated, as slipcasting is very much an art and a science that takes skill and practice. The mugs didn't come out quite as crisp and clean as I was hoping, but we successfully created three sets of the four mugs in varying glaze colors. As the dates for the pop-up got closer I decided to devote my energy to other planning aspects since the pottery was a huge timesink. In tandem with the mugs I made, I also sourced mugs and glassware from Loveramics; a very reputable maker who does beatuiful work.

## Apartment layout redesign
With a bold invite list of 50+ people, I knew I needed to turn my 1-bedroom loft into a functional and beautiful space that emulated a coffee-shop as much as possible. I wanted to do this on a budget and without getting items that would become waste after the pop-up concluded. I completely rearranged the floor plan in my living room to create as much open space as I could while also including as many seats for guests as possible. From the redesign and the addition of 2 small round tables that were trash-picked and bought second hand, I went from 6 available seats in my living room to 15 available seats. Funnily enough, most people chose to stand and socialize during the event!

## Handmaking drink ingredients and garnishes
Nearly everything was homemade for the pop-up except for the milks and tonic water. This included all of the speciality drink syrups, juices, and jams. Through drink testing, we were pleasantly surprised at how much more control we had of the flavor profile and overall quality of the drink with homemade ingredients vs. the store-bought counterpart.

## Building a brand for Creature of Habit
I've always described myself as a very habitual person. Throughout my life and my accolades, this habitualness has defined my personality and work ethic, for better and for worse. As I've matured these past few years, I've started to see more of the negative sides of being a "creature of habit" and have started to try and break that mould. That's where the name of this brand and my journey into the specialty coffee indutry stems from. I've realized I have to open myself up to new opportunities and be willing to fail and learn from those failures. Without being willing to break some of my habits, I'll never grow. The name "Creature of Habit" is a nod to this, but also to the idea that we all have as humans have our rituals and habits that we live and die by. Luckily one of those habits for many is drinking coffee.

## Screenprinting Merchandise
For the first pop-up I wanted to create a unique experience and have something the guests could take as a memento. I was able to incorporate my hobby of screenprinting to burn screens with different treatments of our logo that guests could print onto an item of their choosing (i.e. shirts, hoodies, totebags, etc.)

## Drink Order Automation

To further streamline workflow and data collection, I created a drink order form with a google sheets that people could pull up on their phone from a QR code and order. I then formatted a live excel sheet to populate the orders in real-time with important specifics about their drink (i.e. temp, milk type, time of order, etc.) This helped me with not only keeping track of orders, but also workflow multitasking. Guests were also able to go back and edit the form to leave feedback about both their drink and the pop-up which auto-populated on a seperate excel sheet.

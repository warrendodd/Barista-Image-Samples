This is a repository of images showcasing my projects and experiences in coffee. These include pop-ups I've hosted, drinks I've made, and other relevant work.

## Creature of Habit - Pop-Up No. 1: Sunrise, Sunset
The first pop-up I hosted was the inception of my brand idea, and I focused on having an input on every detail as I could. The theme centered around the transition from Summer to Fall. As someone who suffers from seasonal affective disorder, I've always felt sadness when summer ends, mixed with a sense of dread for the coming fall and winter weather. I wanted this pop-up to celebrate the summer season and welcome in the new fall season. This is where the name _Sunrise, Sunset_ came from, and I hosted it on the weekend of the Fall Equinox, September 21 & 22, 2024.

I was involved in all the aspects of the pop-up including:
  - Coffee Selection
  - Creation of Drink Menu
  - Creation of Pastry Menu
  - Retro-fitting a coffee bar
  - Creating and Sourcing Drinkware
  - Adding and re-arranging furniture in our home
  - Handmaking drink ingredients and garnishes
  - Building a brand for Creature of Habit
  - Screenprinting Merchandise


This included doing an espresso bar build-out from an antique kitchen island, completely redesigning my home to feel like a cafe,
